login is working

add geodjango and make location feature working

or just add a field in model and add latitude and longitude and then add and subtract some value to get a range and then
just filter users out on this basis

geodjango will be good in long run



==========2=======
everything is working fine
we get user filtered on their location

we have to solve user location input from js to django
